This section contains the project analysis done using Alloy.\\
\subsection{Introduction}
The alloy model is focused on the main entities and rules of SS:
\begin{itemize}
	\item User-made reports
	\item Main actors
	\item Rules regarding user-made reports
	\item Rules regarding police intervention
	\item Rules regarding data mining rights
\end{itemize}
While, on the other hand, cross-database interactions have not been modeled and the relation between area and violation has not been modeled in its entirety, as the rules about how to assign a violation to an area are missing.\\  
For semplicity of representation the various violation types, two child signatures have been introduced. Note that, in reality, violation types are more than 2 and will be represented in a different way.\\
The alloy representation is also missing the SysAdmin and Device (and child elements) representation.\\
