This section contains the project analysis done using Alloy. The .als file can be found inside the RASD directory \\
\subsection{Introduction}
The alloy model is focused on the main entities and rules of SS:
\begin{itemize}
	\item User-made reports
	\item Main actors
	\item Rules regarding user-made reports
	\item Rules regarding police intervention
	\item Rules regarding data mining rights
\end{itemize}
While, on the other hand, cross-database interactions have not been modeled and the relation between area and violation has not been modeled in its entirety, as the rules about how to assign a violation to an area are missing.\\
