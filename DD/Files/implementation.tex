In this Section SafeStreets implementation, integration and testing will be discussed

\subsection{Implementation Plan}
SafeStreets implementation wil start from the data tier moving towards presentation tier. This was chosen in order to be able to both unit-test every component implemented and test all that has been implemented to that time. This is possible due to the flow of information that derives from the proposed client-server structure.\newline
SafeStreets implementation will thus follow this order:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database server: the database server will be the first part to be implemented, since all of its functions (ranging from submitting reports to even allow users to log in and out of the app) depend on it. A relational database management system has been chosen
	\item Database server - application server connection
	\item Application server: the application server components will be implemented in order of relevance, while still paying attention to any relation between the components. The order will be the following one:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item UserRegistration
		\item LogOperation
		\item SendReport
		\item RetriveEquiReport
		\item PoliceAction
		\item QueryOnData
		\item QueryOnAnalyzedData
	\end{itemize}
	This is so because in order to be able to perform any kind of action there must be registered users (UserRegistration) and said users need to be able to log in their accounts(LogOperations) and submit reports(SendReport). Also, police has to be able to take action on said reports (RetriveEquiReports, then PoliceAction)  and municipal authorities must be able to mine data and cross database informations (RetriveEquiReports, then QueryOnData). Last but not least, users need to query data mined by the authorities (QueryOnAnalizedData).
	\item Load balancer: off-the-shelf CISCO solution
	\item clients - application server connection
	\item clients: in order for the application to work in its basic functions RegularUser client will be implemented first, Policemen and MunicipalAuthority clients will follow.\newline
	Order of implementation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item RegularUser client:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item SendRegistrationData
				\item SendLogData
				\item SendReport
				\item MapRequest
			\end{itemize}
			\item Policeman client:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ReportListRequest (SendRegistrationData and SendLogData have already been implemented)
				\item SendReportChosen
				\item SendReport (different from RegularUser omonimous component)
				\item SendReportSolved
			\end{itemize}
			\item MunicipalAuthoritiesClient:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item DataRequest (SendLogData has already been implemented)
					\item SendCrashData
					\item MineData
				\end{itemize} 
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
