In this Section SafeStreets implementation, integration and testing will be discussed.
\\

\subsection{Implementation Plan}
SafeStreets implementation wil start from the data tier moving towards presentation tier. This was chosen in order to be able to both unit-test every component implemented and test all that has been implemented to that time. This is possible due to the flow of information that derives from the proposed client-server structure.\newline
SafeStreets implementation will thus follow this order:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database server: the database server will be the first part to be implemented, since all of its functions (ranging from submitting reports to even allow users to log in and out of the app) depend on it. A relational database management system has been chosen
	\item Database server - application server connection
	\item Application server: the application server components will be implemented in order of relevance, while still paying attention to any relation between the components. The order will be the following one:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item UserRegistration
		\item LogOperation
		\item SendReport
		\item RetriveEquiReport
		\item PoliceAction
		\item QueryOnData
		\item QueryOnAnalyzedData
	\end{itemize}
	This is so because in order to be able to perform any kind of action there must be registered users (UserRegistration) and said users need to be able to log in their accounts(LogOperations) and submit reports(SendReport). Also, police has to be able to take action on said reports (RetriveEquiReports, then PoliceAction)  and municipal authorities must be able to mine data and cross database informations (RetriveEquiReports, then QueryOnData). Last but not least, users need to query data mined by the authorities (QueryOnAnalizedData).
	\item Load balancer: off-the-shelf CISCO solution
	\item clients - application server connection
	\item clients: in order for the application to work in its basic functions RegularUser client will be implemented first, Policemen and MunicipalAuthority clients will follow.\newline
	Order of implementation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item RegularUser client:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item SendRegistrationData
				\item SendLogData
				\item SendReport
				\item MapRequest
			\end{itemize}
			\item Policeman client:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ReportListRequest (SendRegistrationData and SendLogData have already been implemented)
				\item SendReportChosen
				\item SendReport (different from RegularUser omonimous component)
				\item SendReportSolved
			\end{itemize}
			\item MunicipalAuthoritiesClient:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item DataRequest (SendLogData has already been implemented)
					\item SendCrashData
					\item MineData
				\end{itemize} 
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Integration Plan}
\subsubsection{Basic conditions}
Integration is the process through which the various implemented components are connected and start interacting with each other.
In order to achieve a meaningful integration, there are some basic condition that must be fulfilled. \par
First of all, the most important condition is that every single component must be working correctly and their functionalities must be tested. In this case, if during integration a problem arises, this must be related only to the integration phase. \par
Another important requirement is that is not necessary for every single component's functionality to be implemented, but at least the main ones and those needed to interact with other components must be tested and correctly operating.

\subsubsection{Integration Database - Application server}
Since Database and Application Server will be the first parts to be implemented, integration between them is of primary importance to ensure the proper conduct of the following operations.
The specific integrations are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item UserRegistration - Database
	\item LogOperation - Database
	\item SendReport - Database
	\item RetrieveEquiReport - Database
	\item PoliceAction - Database
	\item QueryOnData - Database
	\item QueryOnAnalyzedData - Database
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration Application server - RegularUser Client}
Regular user client will be the first one to be integrated with the application server in order for the application to work in its basic functions.
Some client Components will also need an integration with Google maps API to operate correctly.
The specific integrations are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SendRegistrationData - UserRegistration
	\item SendLogData - LogOperation
	\item SendReport(Client) - SendReport(Server)
	\item SendReport(Client) - GoogleMapsAPI
	\item MapRequest - QueryOnAnalyzedData
	\item MapRequest - GoogleMapsAPI
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration Application server - Policemen Client/MunicipalAuthority client}
As already said for the regular user client, also policemen and authorities client will have components that need an integration with Google maps API. \\ \par
for policemen client, the specific integrations are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SendLogData - LogOperation	
	\item ReportListRequest - RetrieveEquiReports
	\item ReportListRequest - GoogleMapsAPI
	\item SendReportChosen - PoliceAction
	\item SendReport(Client) - SendReport(Server)
	\item SendReport(Client) - GoogleMapsAPI
	\item SendReport(Client) - SendReportChosen
	\item SendReportSolved - PoliceAction
\end{itemize}
On the other end, for municipal authorities, the specific integrations are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SendLogData - LogOperation
	\item SendCrashData - 	
	\item DataRequest - QueryOnAnalyzedData
	\item DataRequest - GoogleMapsAPI
	\item MineData - QueryOnData
\end{itemize}
