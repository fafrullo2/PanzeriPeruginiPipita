\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a more detailed description than the one already given in the RASD document about the SafeStreets system. This document is mainly addressed to developers, as it focuses on the illustration of specific components and design choices. The aim is to guide developers during implementation, integration and testing.\par
The aspects covered by the design document are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item High level architecture of SafeStreets.
	\item Structure of the main components and their respective interfaces through which they communicate.
	\item Expected runtime behaviour.
	\item How requirements defined in the RASD map to the design elements of this document.
	\item Implementation, Integration and Testing plan.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}
SafeStreets is a software that aims to collect data coming from registered users in the form of reports and allow either basic users, policemen and municipalities to mine this data with different levels of detail.
The stakeholders of the system will be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users: Simple users that want to report traffic violations or have insight of the most unsafe areas of a city.
	\item Policemen: Members of the local police that need to access the data about users' reports and possibly take actions based on these. 
	\item Municipalities: Members of the municipality that need to mine data to strengthen city's safety.
\end{itemize}
Data coming from the users is collected by SafeStreets servers that organises reports and build statistics out of them.
They also collect data coming from municipalities and cross it with informations collected from the users.
The main functions of SafeStreets are managing request from different users and saving and protecting a relevant ammount of data.\newline
A registration is needed to exploit the various functionalities, reducing the possibility of false reports. Personal and sensitive informations required during registration process, are quite limited and only collected in order to reduce service abuse. In this way the system ensures an adeguate level of user privacy, reducing at the same time the costs of sensitive data management and protection.\newline
In addiction, every data treatment will be carried on respecting every applicable privacy regulation, such as GDPR, and users will be informed about data collection and its porpuses in a dedicated privacy policy.\newline
To ensure an even higher level of transparency, SafeStreets will ask users permission to access device data or modules, such as GPS and camera, according to last mobile OSes privacy policies.
